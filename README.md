BeerMath.net lets brewers calculate expected values for their recipes. Written entirely in C#, it can be used in any .Net language.

See the [Documentation](https://github.com/vtbassmatt/BeerMath.Net/tree/master/Documentation) to learn what calculations are currently included. The original goal of the project was to model every calculation present on http://www.grimmysbeer.com/.
