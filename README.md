BeerMath.net lets brewers calculate expected values for their recipes. Written entirely in C#, it can be used in any .Net language.

[Get started!](https://github.com/vtbassmatt/BeerMath.Net/tree/master/Documentation/GettingStarted.md)

There's a little more [documentation](https://github.com/vtbassmatt/BeerMath.Net/tree/master/Documentation) besides the Get Started guide. The original goal of the project was to model every calculation present on http://www.grimmysbeer.com/. That server seems to have fallen offline in the 7 years since this project was last touched.
